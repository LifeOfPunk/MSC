                            The Meta Side Table is one of our signature pieces and well suited to all communal living spaces and bedrooms. 
                            Consisting of a series of arranged, powder coated rectangular and circular shapes, Meta’s appearance changes 
                            from delicate and thin, to substantial and full depending on the viewing angle. Featuring multi-directional storage for your reading material
                            and an even top for decorative accessories.

                        <p> 
                            Designed as a versatile storage option, the Float Shelf is open to diverse interpretations – holding a book as a bedside or side table,
                            bearing weight as wall console, storing a magazine collection, serving as a compact standing desk, or safeguarding small personal essentials as a hallway tray. 
                            The Float Shelf equally adds a touch of character to hotel rooms, boutique accommodation and boardinghouses. Embodying purity at its most elegant degree, the strict 
                            geometry of this wall-mounted shelf lends its form a sculptural appeal. The Float Shelf consists of two offset levels cut from a single sheet of aluminum, with
                            a simple two-fold composition allowing for flexible placement, use and display. Referencing the reduced aesthetic principles of modernism in the Bauhaus tradition, 
                            its design distils the essence of a shelf.
